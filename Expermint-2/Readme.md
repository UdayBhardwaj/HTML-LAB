This project creates a simple banking interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that lets users deposit and withdraw money while showing real-time balance updates. 
The structure is built with HTML elements like an input field (`<input id="amount">`), balance display (`<span id="balance">`), and action buttons (`<button onclick="deposit()">`). 
CSS styles the layout for a clean, centered look (`.container`, `body`, `button`). JavaScript handles the logic: `deposit()` and `withdraw()` functions read the input, validate the amount, 
update the `balance` variable, and display messages using `document.getElementById()` methods.
