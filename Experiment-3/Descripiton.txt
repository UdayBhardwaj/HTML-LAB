 **1. Theme Switch (Dark Mode)**

* **What it does:** A checkbox lets you flip between Light Mode and Dark Mode.

* **What to check:**

  * **Light Mode (default):**

    * Header & Footer: Green (`rgb(56, 201, 56)`)
    * Nav: Gray (`rgb(113, 111, 111)`)
    * Main area: White
  * Dark Mode (checked):

    * Header & Footer: Dark gray (`rgb(113, 111, 111)`)
    * Nav: Light gray (`rgb(244, 236, 236)`)
    * Main area: Very dark gray (`rgb(40, 39, 39)`)

* Passes if:

  * Clicking the "Dark Mode" label toggles the theme instantly.
  * Colors update exactly as above.

* Fails if:

  * Clicking outside the label does nothing.
  * Layout breaks or colors don’t switch.

 **2. Layout & Responsiveness**

* What it does: Uses CSS Grid to create a neat layout:

  * Left column: Navigation (200px fixed width)
  * Right column: Main content (adjusts to fit)
  * Top row: Header (150px tall, spans across both columns)
  * Bottom row: Footer (100px tall, also spans both columns)

* *asses if:

  * The nav stays o the left, main content fills the rest.
  * Header and footer stretch across the screen evenly.
  * Everything still lines up after resizing the brwser.

* Fails if:

  * Nav overlaps the main content.
  * Header/footer shift out of place when resizing.

---

 **3. Navigation Links**

* What it does:** Displays links (“Home”, “Users”, “Settings”) in a vertical column.

* Passes if:

  * All links are vsible in both Light and Dark Mode.
  * Background color updates with the theme.

* Fails if:

  * Any link is cut off or disappears.
  * Background color doesn’t change after toggling.

---

**4. Main Content Area**

* **What it does:** Shows “Welcome, Admin!” and a placeholder text for reports, charts, etc.

* Passes if:

  * Text is readable in both Light and Dark Mode.
  * Area resizes correctly with the browser.

* Fails if:

  * Background stays stuck in one color after toggling.
  * Text is hidden or overflowing out of the grid.
