                  Dynamic Product Filter

1. Feature Overview

* Goal: Allow users to filter and view only the products they want by selecting a category from a dropdown.
* How it works:

  * A dropdown lists categories like All, Shoes, Shirts, and Gadgets.
  * When a category is selected, the product list updates instantly to show only matching items.
  * Selecting “All” resets the list to show everything.

Successful when:

* Only the relevant products are visible for the chosen category.
* Switching between categories updates the list immediately without page reload.

Unsuccessful when:

* All products remain visible or none show up.
* Changes are slow or unresponsive.

2. Layout & Positioning

* Goal: Display the dropdown and product list clearly and neatly.
* How it works:

  * The dropdown is placed above the list for easy access.
  * Products are arranged in a vertical list for simple scanning.

Successful when:

* The dropdown and list are aligned properly and easy to use.
* Items are spaced and readable on different screen sizes.

Unsuccessful when:

* Dropdown or items overlap or appear misplaced.
* List becomes cluttered or misaligned.

3. Visual Styling

* Goal: Keep the interface simple and user-friendly.
* How it works:

  * Each product appears as a clear list item.
  * The dropdown options are labeled and easy to understand.

Successful when:

* Users can quickly identify categories and products.
* Items remain clear and accessible.

Unsuccessful when:

* Items are hard to read or visually blend together.
* Labels are unclear or missing.

4. Script Behavior

* Goal: Ensure smooth and efficient filtering with JavaScript.
* How it works:

  * JavaScript listens for changes in the dropdown using the `change` event.
  * A function checks each product’s category and shows or hides it based on the selection.
  * Works without reloading the page for a seamless experience.

Successful when:

* Each selection instantly filters the list.
* Logic works consistently for all categories.

Unsuccessful when:

* Some items do not update or disappear incorrectly.
* Page refresh is needed for changes to appear.
