Experiment 9: Person Class Hierarchy with Student and Teacher Subclasses (React Version)

Title:
Person Class Hierarchy with Student and Teacher Subclasses

Objective:
Understand and apply the concept of inheritance in JavaScript (ES6 classes) by creating a base class 
and extending it into specialized subclasses, and then using these classes inside a React component. 
This helps build strong foundational skills in object-oriented programming within a modern JavaScript 
and React context.

Task Description:
1. Create a base Person class with properties like name and age, and a method to display basic information.
2. Create a Student subclass that extends Person, adds a property for course, and overrides the displayInfo method.
3. Create a Teacher subclass that extends Person, adds a property for subject, and overrides the displayInfo method.
4. Inside a React component (App), create instances of Student and Teacher and render their details 
   using the displayInfo() method.
5. The output should be shown dynamically on the web page instead of the console.

Code Summary:
- Person, Student, and Teacher classes are defined using ES6 syntax.
- Student and Teacher use the "extends" keyword to inherit from Person.
- The "super()" function is used to call the parent constructor.
- Method overriding is applied to display full details of Student and Teacher.
- In the React App component, objects are created and their displayInfo() methods are called 
  to render the results in the browser.

Expected Output (on webpage):
Experiment 9: Person Class Hierarchy
Student -> Name: Alice, Age: 20, Course: Computer Science
Teacher -> Name: Mr. John, Age: 40, Subject: Mathematics
