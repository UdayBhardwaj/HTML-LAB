Library Management System Using React

Objective
To build a simple Library Management application using React that allows users to add, search, and remove books dynamically.

Task Description
This project demonstrates the use of React state and event handling. The app manages a collection of books, where each book has a title and an author. Users can:

- Search books by title or author.
- Add a new book by entering its title and author.
- Remove an existing book from the list.

The application updates the list dynamically without refreshing the page.

Implementation Details
1. App.jsx
   - Uses useState to store the list of books, search text, and input values.
   - Add Book Function: Appends a new book if both title and author are provided.
   - Remove Book Function: Deletes a selected book by its index.
   - Filter Function: Filters the displayed list based on the search input.

2. App.css
   - Styles the container with borders and padding.
   - Adds spacing for input fields and buttons.
   - Styles each book entry as a separate box with a remove button.

Expected Output
- A Library Management interface with:
  - Search bar (filter books by title/author).
  - Input fields to add a new book.
  - A list of books showing title and author.
  - A remove button next to each book.

When users type in the search box, only matching books are displayed.

Learning Outcome
- Practical understanding of React useState hook.
- Implementing dynamic list rendering with .map().
- Managing forms and event handling in React.
- Using filter and array methods for state updates.
